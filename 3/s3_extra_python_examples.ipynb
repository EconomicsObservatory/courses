    "### 1.2 Understanding Data Types\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, data types are crucial as they define the operations possible on the values and how they can be stored. Here are some of the basic data types you'll frequently encounter:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Integers** (`int`): Whole numbers, positive or negative, without decimals. Useful for counting or indexing. For example, age = 25.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Floating Point Numbers** (`float`): Numbers with a decimal point. Perfect for measurements or any calculations requiring precision. For example, inflation = 1.3\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Strings** (`str`): A sequence of characters, enclosed in single (' ') or double (\" \") quotes. Strings are how text is represented. For example, name = \"John Doe\".\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Lists** (`list`): An ordered collection of items, which can be of mixed data types. Lists are versatile and can be modified (mutable). These are written as a list with comma separated values (items) between square brackets. For example, fruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"].\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dictionaries** (`dict`): A collection of key-value pairs. Each key-value pair maps the key to its associated value, making dictionaries perfect for storing data in a structured way, similar to JSON objects from APIs. For example, person = {\"name\": \"John\", \"age\": 25}. When we interact with JSON objects within Python, these are of dictionary type.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint**: Find out more about Python data types [here](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_datatypes.asp)\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding these types is essential because they determine what kind of operations you can perform on the data. For instance, you can add two integers or concatenate strings but trying to mix types without conversion (like adding a string to an integer) will lead to errors."
