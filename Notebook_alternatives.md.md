# Alternative Notebook Links

Ordinarily all notebooks should be used with Google Colab. However, this requires a Google account.

If you do not have a Google account or otherwise cannot use Google Colab, these links will open the notebooks in another tool that does not require a login.

## Session 3: Fetching data from APIs

-  [ðŸ¥¾s3_workbook_Loops_APIs.ipynb](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/EconomicsObservatory/courses/HEAD?labpath=3%2Fs3_workbook_Loops_APIs.ipynb) is an example that you can start with. This link takes you to the `Binder` user interface, where you can run Python code from your browser without logging in.
