# üìä Datasets
**BYOD: We encourage you to Bring Your Own Data to the masterclass**.   
It can be data about everything, the financial report from the the last quarter or your sales logbook from your small coffee shop. It can be in any format `CSV, Excel, Stata, Matlab, JSON, etc.`  - or even just a table from a website, up to a cumbersome `API` call, we'll work with it.

If you want to look beyond, these data repositories are widely used by the community  
- https://huggingface.co/datasets  
- https://visualdata.io/discovery  
- https://paperswithcode.com/datasets  

Below, you can find some example datasets that you might want to use today.

## üéÆ Action points

- If you **BYOD**, the	targeted complexity should be around `1000 data points` in at least `3 dimensions`. Say you have a small shop and you have sales data about `3` products ‚Äì this counts as `3` dimensions: the `sales value` (time series), the `time` (record date) and the `product` (name). Even better if you have this for different `cities` ‚Äì a `4`th dimension.

üêò *If you know what you are doing, convert your data into `JSON` format or just ping us the link to **any `API`** that you would like to explore a day before the class.  

ü¶è If you *really* know what you are doing, send us a link to your `*.ipynb` file or *Colab notebook* with any questions related to it a day before the class.

## Dataset Finders
 
Similar to how [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/) works, [Google Dataset Search](https://toolbox.google.com/datasetsearch) lets you find datasets wherever they are hosted, whether it‚Äôs a publisher‚Äôs site, a digital library, or an author‚Äôs web page. It‚Äôs a phenomenal dataset finder, and it contains over 25 million datasets.

[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) provides a vast container of datasets, sufficient for the enthusiast to the expert.

The [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/) at [UCI](https://www.uci.edu/) provides an up to date resource for open-source datasets.

[VisualData](https://www.visualdata.io/): Discover computer vision datasets by category; it allows searchable queries.

[CMU Libraries](https://guides.library.cmu.edu/machine-learning/datasets
)): Discover high-quality datasets thanks to the collection of Huajin Wang, at [CMU](https://www.cmu.edu/).

The [The Big Bad NLP Database](https://datasets.quantumstat.com/) contains datasets for various natural language processing tasks, created and curated by [Quantum Stat](https://quantumstat.com/).
