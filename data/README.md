Welcome to our interactive data masterclass. At the **Economics Observatory** we believe that the future of effective science communication is a blend of data and text. Dashboards without context are too cluttered and text without explanatory graphics is difficult to grasp. Therefore, we have partnered with educators from leading institutions across teh country to be able to offer masterclasses in [Writing](/writing) and [Data](/data).

in our day-to-day work the **Economics Observatory**, we use data to amplify and distil the messages of our articles. Making charts clear and eye-catching, while also ensuring that the underlying data are transparent and replicable, is critical to what we do. This masterclass is designed to capture and share that workflow.

## üîç Scope

Our data visualisation masterclass will take you from a being complete beginner to someone capable of designing and building stunning charts using cutting-edge tools, connected to live data. The course is designed to highlight the advantages and some caveats of using data visualisation as the main channel for communicating (economic) information to a wide and diverse audience. It will also introduce some of our guiding principles on visualisation, focusing on transparency and how to select appropriate tools and methods for different datasets and contexts.

You will gain the skills and tools needed to create excellent charts. The course will also signpost additional resources to develop the ideas further, allowing participants to gain confidence in their own abilities and teach others. The latter stages of the course will delve deeper into the current information representation and science communication theory, exploring more advanced data visualisation methods.

## üìä Datasets
**BYOD: We encourage you to Bring Your Own Data to the masterclass**.   
It can be data about everything, the financial report from the the last quarter or your sales logbook from your small coffee shop. It can be in any format `CSV, Excel, Stata, Matlab, JSON, etc.`  - or even just a table from a website, we'll work with it.
