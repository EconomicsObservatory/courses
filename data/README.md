Welcome to our interactive data masterclass. At the **Economics Observatory** we believe that the future of effective science communication is a blend of data and text. Dashboards without context are too cluttered and text without explanatory graphics is difficult to grasp. Therefore, we have partnered with educators from leading institutions across teh country to be able to offer masterclasses in [Writing](/writing) and [Data](/data).

in our day-to-day work the **Economics Observatory**, we use data to amplify and distil the messages of our articles. Making charts clear and eye-catching, while also ensuring that the underlying data are transparent and replicable, is critical to what we do. This masterclass is designed to capture and share that workflow.

## üîç Scope

Our data visualisation masterclass will take you from a being complete beginner to someone capable of designing and building stunning charts using cutting-edge tools, connected to live data. The course is designed to highlight the advantages and some caveats of using data visualisation as the main channel for communicating (economic) information to a wide and diverse audience. It will also introduce some of our guiding principles on visualisation, focusing on transparency and how to select appropriate tools and methods for different datasets and contexts.

You will gain the skills and tools needed to create excellent charts. The course will also signpost additional resources to develop the ideas further, allowing participants to gain confidence in their own abilities and teach others. The latter stages of the course will delve deeper into the current information representation and science communication theory, exploring more advanced data visualisation methods.

## üìë Syllabus

### Session 1 - Building your first website

`Coordinated by: Prof Richard Davies`  
  
In the first session we introduce HTML, CSS and JavaScript as you build and style your first website. You will also embed your first automated and interactive charts.

1.	Introduction + building blocks

-	Motivation   
What is good Data Science? Where does it sit? Principles.
- Web building blocks: HTML, CSS and JS  
(visualisations are _just üåü fancy üåü websites_ built from components)
- Building your first interactive web site
- [GitHub](https://github.com/) pages
- Introduction 

2.	Charting principles
- The good the bad and the ugly
- History
- Good charting guide
- Making two live and interactive charts
- Introduction to charting libraries

#### üéÆ Action points

- Please watch this introductory video
- Set up your own [GitHub](https://github.com/) account at `username` and repository at `username.github.io`. This becomes your own website. In the end, your GitHub should look like [this](https://github.com/eco-demo-student).
- Create a demo `index.html` page in your repository and add 3 sentences about yourself.:
  -  Why are you here?
  -  What is your level experience?
  -  What would you like to learn?
-  You should end up with something like [this](https://eco-demo-student.github.io/) .

### Session 2 - Introduction to data processing

`Coordinated by: Prof Richard Davies`  

The third session is devoted to loops, one of the most powerful tools in any coder‚Äôs arsenal. We will show how a loop takes you from a small dataset to the world of big data.

Programming for Data Science (RD)
‚Ä¢	Conditionality statements.
‚Ä¢	For loops.
‚Ä¢	Elegance in code.	Accessing Data 3
‚Ä¢	Loops. 
‚Ä¢	Multi-dimensional data


### Session 3 - Accessing data programmatically

`Coordinated by: Dr D√©nes Csala`  

In our third session we access data from APIs, discussing the benefits, pitfalls and debugging.

DC
Python
JSON
Pandas
read_html
read API / 
ECO API
scraping / Selenium for connoisseurs 

### Session 4 - Visualisation and advanced analytics

`Coordinated by: Dr D√©nes Csala`  

This session

### Self-guided learning

In the final session we will build tools to learn from the data. We will discuss Machine Learning (ML) and the difference between ‚Äúsupervised‚Äù and ‚Äúunsupervised‚Äù learning, as well as the use of labelled and unlabelled data.


## üñáÔ∏è Pre-requisites
We don't require any prior knowledge of programming or data science, other than high-school level mathematics and statistics. However, it helps us speed up things on the day if you do some preparation before the class:

## üìä Datasets
**BYOD: We encourage you to Bring Your Own Data to the masterclass**.   
It can be data about everything, the financial report from the the last quarter or your sales logbook from your small coffee shop. It can be in any format `CSV, Excel, Stata, Matlab, JSON, etc.`  - or even just a table from a website, we'll work with it.

### Dataset Finders
https://toolbox.google.com/datasetsearch
Google Dataset Search: Similar to how Google Scholar works, Dataset Search lets you find datasets wherever they are hosted, whether it‚Äôs a publisher‚Äôs site, a digital library, or an author‚Äôs web page. It‚Äôs a phenomenal dataset finder, and it contains over 25 million datasets.

https://www.kaggle.com/
Kaggle: Kaggle provides a vast container of datasets, sufficient for the enthusiast to the expert.

http://mlr.cs.umass.edu/ml/
UCI Machine Learning Repository: The Machine Learning Repository at UCI provides an up to date resource for open-source datasets.

https://www.visualdata.io/
VisualData: Discover computer vision datasets by category; it allows searchable queries.

https://guides.library.cmu.edu/machine-learning/datasets
CMU Libraries: Discover high-quality datasets thanks to the collection of Huajin Wang, at CMU.
